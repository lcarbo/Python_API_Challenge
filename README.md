# Python_API_Challenge

In this assignment I was tasked with compiling weather data from 500+ cities, randomly selected, by querying the Open Weather API. From there I conducted a statistical analysis and plotted the results to determine which weather factors were impacted by latitude. Next, I whittled down the list of cities based on desireable criteria (humidity levels and temperature) to create a list of possible vacation destinations for which I queried the Google Places API to identify possible hotels to stay in. I plotted all the hotels and vacation options using the Google maps.
